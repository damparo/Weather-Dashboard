# Weather-Dashboard

## Project Goal

The goal of this assignment was to create a weather dasboard that featured current weather conditions and a five day forecast for any city.

## Functionality

The dashboard was built using dynamic functions/buttons and relied upon setting up API calls to retrieve weather information.  Once retrieved, the information would be locally stored and then be re-displayed if its city was selected.

## Thoughts:
For some reason my local storage was not working properly so I have to go back and rework it.  Also, I decided to build the five day forecast using jquery so the layout is not horizontal.

## Update:
Local storage is now functional.  Card Layout is correct.  There are still some features that need to be addressed for a later time.
